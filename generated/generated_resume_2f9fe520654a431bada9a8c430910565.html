Quantify achievements whenever possible.  For example:]</p><p>    * **Project Title:** [Project Name]</p><p>        * Developed a [brief description of the project and its purpose] using [technologies used, e.g., Python, TensorFlow].</p><p>        * Implemented [specific feature or algorithm], resulting in a [quantifiable result, e.g., 15% improvement in efficiency].</p><p>        * Successfully presented project findings to [audience].</p><p>* [Add another project or two if possible.

Tailor this resume to specific job descriptions at Google for maximum impact. Consider focusing on specific Google departments or teams that align with your interests and skills.  Also, consider adding a portfolio link if you have one showcasing your projects.</p>
